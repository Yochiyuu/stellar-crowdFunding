# üí° SmartCrowd: A Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform on Soroban

## üöÄ Project Description

SmartCrowd is a **fully decentralized Crowdfunding Platform** implemented on the **XX Blockchain** using Soroban. This project consists of two main contracts: a custom **Token Contract** for donations, and a **Crowdfunding Contract** to manage campaign logistics. Users can create time-bound campaigns with specific funding goals. Donors can contribute using the specified token and are eligible for a refund if the campaign fails to meet its goal by the deadline. The platform leverages Soroban's speed and transparency to ensure a secure and trustless fundraising environment on the Stellar network.

## üéØ Vision

Our vision is to unlock **global micro-funding opportunities**, building a transparent and trustless digital frontier for capital mobilization. By leveraging Soroban's low-cost, high-speed transactions, **SmartCrowd** will redefine decentralized community funding, empowering creators and innovators worldwide. We aim to **create abundance** by bridging the funding gap and fostering the next wave of decentralized innovation.

## üîß Technical Project Details

This fully decentralized Crowdfunding Platform is built on the **Soroban** smart contract platform. The project features two robust contracts: a custom **Token Contract** to handle donations and a **Crowdfunding Contract** to manage all campaign logistics.

Users can create time-limited fundraising campaigns with a specific goal, donate using the designated token, and claim a refund if the campaign fails to reach its target by the deadline. The platform utilizes Soroban's native capabilities for transparency and secure asset movement on the Stellar network, ensuring a **trustless** fundraising environment.

## üó∫Ô∏è Software Development Plan

This development plan focuses on the smart contracts and front-end integration in 5 key steps:

1.  **Smart Contract Core Development (Rust):** Implement the core of the `TokenContract` and `CrowdfundingContract`. The `Crowdfunding` contract must manage key states, including a `Campaign` struct (`owner`, `goal`, `raised`, `donations`) and a global map for active campaigns (`CAMPAIGNS`).
2.  **Smart Contract Functions and Features:** Develop and test essential functions like `create_campaign(owner, goal, deadline, token)`, `donate(campaign_id, donor, amount)` which calls `token.transfer()`, and `refund(campaign_id, donor)` with strict validation.
3.  **Frontend Setup & Bindings (React/TypeScript):** Set up the React Router and Tailwind CSS environment. **Generate TypeScript bindings** for both contracts (`crowdfunding-contract` and `token-contract`) to ensure type-safe interaction with the backend.
4.  **Frontend Development (UI/UX):** Implement core functionality: displaying the current campaign status and integrating the new **Create Campaign** feature with Goal and Deadline input forms.
5.  **Deployment & Final Testing:** Deploy the WASM binaries (`token.wasm`, `crowdfunding.wasm`) to the Stellar Testnet, followed by complete end-to-end testing via the live frontend (*Create Campaign* -> *Donate* -> *Refund*).

## üí¨ Personal Story

I started this journey to solve a fundamental problem: making community fundraising truly **transparent**. Building on Soroban was a technical challenge, especially integrating a custom token and managing inter-contract calls for refunds. Seeing the tests pass and the logic execute on the Testnet was incredibly satisfying. This project is my first step toward actively contributing to a more decentralized financial ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide (Frontend & Backend)

This project is divided into two parts: the Rust smart contracts (backend) and the React/TypeScript web app (frontend).

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* **Rust** (`rustup`)
* **Soroban CLI** (`soroban` and `stellar` commands)
* **Node.js** (v20+) and **npm**
* A funded **Testnet** account (e.g., your `alice` identity).

### 1. Backend: Build and Deploy Contracts

Navigate to your backend project's root directory (e.g., `my-token-project`).

**a. Build Contracts:**

```bash
# Build Token Contract
cd contracts/token && stellar contract build

# Build Crowdfunding Contract
cd ../crowdfunding && stellar contract build
cd ../..

### 2. Frontend: Configure and Run

Navigate to your frontend directory (e.g., `crowdfund`).

**a. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
